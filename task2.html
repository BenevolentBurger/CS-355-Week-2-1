    <h1>Revelation</h1>
    <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
    
    <p>
        We make ourselves a place apart<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind light words that tease and flout,<br>
        But oh, the agitated heart<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till someone find us really out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        'Tis pity if the case require<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end<br>
        We speak the literal to inspire<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of a friend.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But so with all, from babes that play<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br>
        So all who hide too well away<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must speak and tell us where they are.
    </p>
